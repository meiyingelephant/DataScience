This project is about analyze customer churn data, and then build machine learning models to find out what kind of customer is about to leave, the result helped to predict what customer will leave, and helped company to provide better services to customers. I used the Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) by Python.
